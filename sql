Hereâ€™s the SQL query explained line by line with a **sample output** based on the described logic.

### Full Query (with Explanation)for cumilative tabel desgins 

#### Step 1: Common Table Expressions (CTEs)
```sql
WITH 
yesterday AS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM players 
    WHERE current_season = 1996
),
today AS (
    SELECT * 
    FROM player_seasons 
    WHERE season = 1997
)
```
- **Purpose**: Define two temporary tables (`yesterday` and `today`):
  1. `yesterday`: Contains player data from the 1996 season.
  2. `today`: Contains player data for the 1997 season.

---

#### Step 2: Insert Statement
```sql
INSERT INTO players (player_name, height, college, country, draft_round, draft_number, season_stats, years_since_last_season, scoring_class, current_season)
```
- **Purpose**: Specifies the target table (`players`) and columns into which data will be inserted.

---

#### Step 3: Data Selection
```sql
SELECT 
    COALESCE(t.player_name, y.player_name) AS player_name,
    COALESCE(t.height, y.height) AS height,
    COALESCE(t.college, y.college) AS college,
    COALESCE(t.country, y.country) AS country,
    COALESCE(t.draft_round, y.draft_round) AS draft_round,
    COALESCE(t.draft_number, y.draft_number) AS draft_number,
```
- **Purpose**: Combines data from `today` (`t`) and `yesterday` (`y`) using `COALESCE`:
  - Takes `t`'s values if available, otherwise uses `y`'s values.

---

#### Step 4: Construct or Append to `season_stats`
```sql
    CASE 
        WHEN y.season_stats IS NULL THEN 
            ARRAY[
                ROW(
                    t.season,
                    t.gp,
                    t.pts,
                    t.reb,
                    t.ast
                )::season_stats
            ]
        WHEN t.season IS NOT NULL THEN 
            y.season_stats || ARRAY[
                ROW(
                    t.season,
                    t.gp,
                    t.pts,
                    t.reb,
                    t.ast
                )::season_stats
            ]
        ELSE 
            y.season_stats
    END AS season_stats,
```
- **Purpose**: Handles `season_stats`:
  1. Creates a new array if `y.season_stats` is missing.
  2. Appends `t`'s stats to `y.season_stats` if available.

---

#### Step 5: Calculate `years_since_last_season`
```sql
    CASE 
        WHEN t.season IS NOT NULL THEN 0
        ELSE COALESCE(y.years_since_last_season, 0) + 1
    END AS years_since_last_season,
```
- **Purpose**: Tracks the number of years since the player was last active:
  - Resets to `0` if `t.season` exists.
  - Increments `y.years_since_last_season` by `1` otherwise.

---

#### Step 6: Assign `scoring_class`
```sql
    CASE 
        WHEN t.season IS NOT NULL THEN
            CASE 
                WHEN t.pts > 20 THEN 'star'
                WHEN t.pts > 15 THEN 'good'
                WHEN t.pts > 10 THEN 'average'
                ELSE 'bad'
            END
        ELSE NULL
    END AS scoring_class,
```
- **Purpose**: Categorizes players based on their scoring (`t.pts`):
  - Assigns `star`, `good`, `average`, or `bad`.
  - Leaves the field as `NULL` if `t.season` is missing.

---

#### Step 7: Set `current_season`
```sql
    COALESCE(t.season, y.current_season + 1) AS current_season
```
- **Purpose**: Determines the season:
  - Uses `t.season` if available.
  - Otherwise, increments `y.current_season`.

---

#### Step 8: Perform Full Outer Join
```sql
FROM today t
FULL OUTER JOIN yesterday y
ON t.player_name = y.player_name;
```
- **Purpose**: Combines `today` and `yesterday` data for all players (even if they only exist in one table).

---

#### Step 9: Query Most Recent Points Ratio
```sql
SELECT 
    player_name,
    (season_stats[CARDINALITY(season_stats)]::season_stats).pts /
    CASE 
        WHEN (season_stats[1]::season_stats).pts = 0 THEN 1 
        ELSE (season_stats[1]::season_stats).pts 
    END AS pts_ratio
FROM players
WHERE current_season = 2001
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
```
- **Purpose**:
  1. Retrieves each player's name and computes the ratio of the most recent season's points to the first season's points.
  2. Filters for players in the 2001 season.
  3. Orders the results by `pts_ratio` (highest to lowest).
